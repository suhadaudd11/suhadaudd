Hello There ‚úåüèª
![Header](./github-header-image.png)

I‚Äôm a software engineering educator, researcher and sometimes a practitioner during my free time. Im now dedicated to advancing sustainable software development practices. My GitHub profile reflects my ongoing journey to integrate innovative technologies with sustainable practices in software engineering.

üåç I‚Äôm currently working on: Developing educational resources theoretically and technically including focused on sustainable software engineering practices. My goal is to promote techniques that balance performance with environmental and economic sustainability.

üìö I‚Äôm currently learning: The latest advancements in sustainable software development, including green computing practices, energy-efficient algorithms, and the impact of software on environmental sustainability.

ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: Projects that explore sustainable software development, including research studies, curriculum development, and open-source tools that support sustainable and maintainable coding practices.

üîç I‚Äôm looking for help with: Integrating sustainable development principles into existing software engineering curricula and collaborating on research that addresses the environmental impact of software systems.

üí¨ Ask me about: Sustainable and maintanable practices in software engineering or how to align software development with sustainability goals.

‚ö° Fun fact: I enjoy exploring how software can be both innovative and environmentally responsible, and I'm always excited to discuss ways to make our digital world more sustainable!

üîó For more about my PhD projects: You can find detailed information and repositories related to my previous research on my old GitHub profile @chuuyaa.

üì´ How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or email me at [nasuha@um.edu.my]. 


‚ö° Fun fact: I love finding ways to make software both innovative and environmentally responsible!
